`TransposeOperator`([API](http://serrano-lib.org/docs/latest/api/Classes/TransposeOperator.html)) 
transposed its input tensors.

**Few notes:**

- The `inputTensors` and `outputTensors` should have same number of tensors.
- All tensors in `inputTensors` should be 2D tensors.


## Initialization 
```swift
let shape = TransposeOperator()
```
